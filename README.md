The Guest Personality & Behavior Expander is a comprehensive OpenRCT2 plugin that dramatically enhances the depth and realism of guest AI by introducing a multi-dimensional personality system. Each guest in your park becomes a unique individual with their own traits, moods, preferences, and behaviors that dynamically influence their park experience.

This plugin transforms the standard guest behavior into a rich simulation where visitors react realistically to rides, weather, crowds, prices, and their own internal states - creating a more immersive and believable theme park experience.
